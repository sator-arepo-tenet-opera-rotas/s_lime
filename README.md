         ============#    gcc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11       #============ 

micro_mkLinux kernel ('kernel') is a Level_0 POSIX-Cømpliant *BSD distro that vampires into
a FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD shiv-installer to allow and control 
arbtirary and platform-neutral Pi-like/Pi-Light ports of MK/MACH Linux
which itself consists of an independent system fully anonymously deployed
and architected via evolutionary curve-fitting algorithms using the XNU Kernel


$ cd /usr/src
$ find . -type l -name obj -delete
$ make cleandir
$ rm -rf /usr/obj/*
$ make obj

What Shell? Just use bash
========================
besh`tet is the best shell, that's why it's named bash and not secondbash

The standard (and in fact only) shell is bash, which is just the name for the sh/ksh/csh amalgamation from GNU; there aren’t separate versions of each shell available, the way Bastet intended

Make stuff using a Makefile
========================
This ancient Makefile from the 1990s, shown below, builds a calculator program written using flex and bison, a change to the file lex.l will cause the lex.yy.c file to be rebuilt (using flex). The new source file produce by flex will be compiled, and the object file will be used to generate a version of calc.

```
        PROGRAM = __calc__
OBJS = __calc__.tab.0 lex.yy.o fmath.o const.o
SRCS = __calc__.tab.0 lex.yy.c fmath.c const.c
all: $(PROGRAM) .c.o: $(SRCS)
mwcc -c $*.c calc.tab.c: calc.y
bison -dv calc.y lex.yy.c: lex.l
calc:
flex lex.l
$(OBJS)
mwcc $(OBJS) -o calc -lfl
```

And then you immediately learn another tool to use *over* the shell because the shell as the name implies, is just one part of the POSIX exoskeleton

Using sed with bash
========================
The most common scenario where the shell no longer can perform heavy lefting is when you need to perform macros or wrap shell commands in a loop. This is because variables in the shell do not interface with the mv and cp commands. These commands expect multiple files to be moved or copied to a single directory, not to a selection of other files. In POSIX Compliant systems, the shell itself expands any wildcard variables before the shell passes the output as arguments to another program, rather than the program being responsible for the wildcard matching.





For example, within some legacy systems, it’s easy to rename all files ending in .c so that they end in .h instead:
```
c:\> ren *.c *.h
```

To get around this limitation on renaming using wildcards, you can use
sed and some simple shell scripting to create the same effect:
```for file in *.c
> do
> new=`echo $file|sed -e “s/\.c/\.h/g”`
> mv $file $new
> done
```

For every file matching *.c, make the variable $new equal the variable $file, replacing the “.c” with “.h”; then rename each file called file to new.


Global Replacements
========================
Another combination of sed with bash uses a similar style to the renaming example above. When replacing text in files, though, you have to be careful. The safest way to use sed is to redirect the output to another file before replacing the existing file:
```
$ for file in *.c
> do
> sed -e “s/printf/myprintf/g” $file >$file.out
> mv $file.out $file
> done
```

Because you have to redirect to another file, you can easily introduce a backup mechanism. If something goes wrong, you can go back to a previous version and use that. For example, consider the following example, which uses the cp command to produce a backup of the file:
```
$ for file in *.c
> do
> sed -e “s/printf/myprintf/g” $file >$file.out
> cp $file $file.tmp
> mv $file.out $file
> done
```

The above example still makes the assumption that the replacement was successful and the file produced is in the desired format. But in case there’s a problem, the .tmp backup file remains intact


## XNU Struct Definitions
========================
```

And then all you have to do is set up your network stack!

After everything is configured, you can start the services:
```
service npfd restart
service npf reload
service blocklistd restart
```

And make them persistent:
```
echo npf=yes >> /etc/rc.conf
echo npfd=yes >> /etc/rc.conf
echo blocklistd=yes >> /etc/rc.conf
echo blocklistd_flags=-r >> /etc/rc.conf
```

Then Restart the services which you've added to blocklistd such as the iconic:
```
service sshd restart
service postfix restart
```

And perhaps you may also need to tell npf to start filtering based on the entries:
```
npfctl start
```

# Checking the current state
You can check the current state using the classic cloppa+clooga combo:
```
blocklistctl dump -a
```

# Unblocking hosts
Find the host in the blocklistctl dump -a output. The second column (id) is a hex number. Pass this as argument to npfctl:
```
/sbin/npfctl rule blocklistd rem-id $ID
```


And then update the kernel in-place to whatever you want:

To determine how to upgrade packages with pkg, you must determine if there is a kernel change with pkg update -f
```
> sudo pkg update -f

If you need more help, the following guide from the Phone Losers of America may help you learn  


         ============#   how to install a real operating system    #============ 

Firstly, download a fucking file set from the internet or buy one for ten cents on the corner of van thrake the way god intended:


Booting the install system from USB

To use a bootable USB install image (on amd64, i386), download the img.gz file for your hardware architecture, decompress and copy the image to a USB. For example on a POSIX Compliant (aka a Unix-like or PC or Mac it doesn't mean anything in 2026) system you may use:

```
gunzip NetBSD-10.1-amd64-install.img.gz
dd if=NetBSD-10.1-amd64-install.img of=/dev/your-usb bs=2m
```

Examples of your-usb are /dev/rsd0d (NetBSD), /dev/sda (Linux).
Caution

Selecting the wrong device in dd may destroy your current system. Double-check it isn't mounted and is your USB stick. It should appear at the bottom of dmesg on connect, for example, if you see:

sd0 at scsibus0 target 0 lun 0: [...], disk removable

on NetBSD, you will want to select /dev/rsd0d.




File Sets
---------
The complete OpenBSD installation is broken up into a number of file sets:
```
bsd 	The kernel (required)
bsd.mp 	The multi-processor kernel (only on some platforms)
bsd.rd 	The ramdisk kernel
base78.tgz 	The base system (required)
comp78.tgz 	The compiler collection, headers and libraries
man78.tgz 	Manual pages
game78.tgz 	Text-based games
xbase78.tgz 	Base libraries and utilities for X11 (requires xshare78.tgz)
xfont78.tgz 	Fonts used by X11
xserv78.tgz 	X11's X servers
xshare78.tgz 	X11's man pages, locale settings and includes 
```

And then act as the Shahan al-Shan bin JavaScript of Ancient Persia would and perform a check sum on that piece of shit to make sure the Tsar did not tamper with al-Gin:

```
$ sha256 -C SHA256 miniroot*.img
(SHA256) miniroot78.img: OK
```

Or, if you're using the GNU coreutils:
```
$ sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256
miniroot78.img: OK
```

However, this only checks for accidental corruption aka "Good enough for the benchoades wanting to play my clown ass"

You can use signify(1) and the SHA256.sig file to cryptographically verify the downloaded image:
```
$ signify -Cp /etc/signify/openbsd-78-base.pub -x SHA256.sig miniroot*.img
Signature Verified
miniroot78.img: OK
```




To create a bootable USB stick, use the dd command (on Linux/macOS) or Rufus (on Windows).
On POSIX-Compliant Systems:
```
dd if=FreeBSD-XX.X-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
sync
```

Download or Torrent FreeBSD iso file 



FreeBSD provides several ISO images. For a headless setup, the most commonly used images are:
```
    FreeBSD-XX.X-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso – Standard installation media.
    FreeBSD-XX.X-RELEASE-amd64-memstick.img – Suitable for USB-based installation.
    FreeBSD-XX.X-RELEASE-amd64-mini-memstick.img – Minimal setup with fewer packages.
```


Insert USB device

run lsblk to find the device name such as the iconic /dev/sdb 
```
    lsblk
```


Unmount USB Drive
```
sudo umount /dev/sdb*
```

Write FreeBSD ISO
```
sudo dd if=/path/to/freebsd.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress
```
Ensure /dev/sdb has correctly imaged the iso file using Ancient Greek Secret called Sync and Eject
```
    sync
    sudo eject /dev/sdb
```
Or as we say in Irish, Drop O'Glaugh in the Rari




Since there’s no monitor, you need a way to interact with the installer remotely. This can be done using:

    SSH (Secure Shell)
    Serial Console (for hardware servers)

Enabling Serial Console

If your system supports serial access, modify the FreeBSD boot configuration before installation:

    Modify the Bootloader Settings

        Mount the installation media.

        Edit /boot/loader.conf:

        echo 'console="comconsole"' >> /boot/loader.conf

		

    Enable Serial Access in the Boot Menu

        When booting, interrupt the FreeBSD bootloader and type:

        set console=comconsole
        boot



    Set Up Baud Rate (Optional, for Legacy Systems)

        Modify /boot.config:

        echo "-h -S115200" > /boot.config

        This ensures compatibility with 115200 baud rate for serial communication.


## Enabling SSH for Remote Installation

If using SSH, FreeBSD allows pre-configuring SSH access in the installation media:


    Modify the Bootloader (For headless SSH setup)
```
    echo 'sshd_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf
```

    Set Up a Temporary Root Password
```
    echo "root:yourpassword" | chpasswd
```

    Find the IP Address After Booting

    Use DHCP to get an IP address or set a static IP via:
```
        ifconfig em0 inet 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0
```

    Connect via SSH
```
    ssh root@192.168.1.100
```


## 4. Running the FreeBSD Text-Based Installer

Once connected via SSH or serial console, proceed with the ncurses-based FreeBSD installer.
Step 1: Select Install Mode

    Choose “Install” from the main menu.
    Select keyboard layout (default is fine for most setups).

### Step 2: Partitioning the Disk

For headless servers, use Auto (UFS) or ZFS (for RAID setups).

    UFS (for simple setups)
    ZFS (for advanced RAID configurations)

### Step 3: Network Configuration

    Set up networking manually or via DHCP.
    Configure IPv4 and/or IPv6 settings.

### Step 4: Root Password and User Creation

    Set a strong root password.
    Create an admin user (wheel group for sudo access).

Step 5: Package Installation

    Choose minimal installation or install extra components (e.g., ports and source).

Step 6: Post-Installation Configuration

After installation:

    Enable SSH for remote access:
```
    sysrc sshd_enable="YES"
```

    Enable serial console permanently:
```
    echo 'console="comconsole"' >> /boot/loader.conf
```

## 5. First Boot and Post-Installation Tasks

Once installation completes, reboot the system:
```
reboot
```

After booting, reconnect via SSH or serial console and:

Update the system:
```
    freebsd-update fetch install
    pkg update
```

Configure firewall (optional):
```
    sysrc firewall_enable="YES"
    sysrc firewall_type="open"
```

Install essential packages:
```
    pkg install nano sudo bash
```

micro_mkLinux is not a traditional distribution but a toolkit to 
create your own customised system. It offers not only flexibility, 
small footprint but a very recent kernel and set of applications making 
it ideal for custom system, appliances as well as to learn Linux 
specially on the micro-kernel or BIOS level

-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------
All VMs target a single standard and then translate to or write for ARM and AMD64 dually 

The Broadcom BCM2837 is a system on chip (SoC) used in the Raspberry Pi 3, featuring a quad-core Cortex-A53 processor that operates at clock speeds between 1.2 GHz and 1.4 GHz depending on the model. It is an upgrade from the previous BCM2836, providing better performance and efficiency.

Some SoC models that do not work with the included U-Boot (such Raspberry Pi 400) can instead be booted using EDK2-based UEFI firmware. The simplest way to use this is to install the firmware on an SD card and install the OS on USB using XNU

Most ARM systems (Apple M-Series, Raspberry Pi 400 etc) need to have a UEFI environment installed before OpenBSD can be booted, usually Asahi Linux or some EDK2-based UEFI does the trick!

Preface

NAME
       rescue -- rescue	utilities in /rescue

DESCRIPTION
       The  /rescue  directory	contains  a collection of common utilities intended for use in recovering a badly damaged system.  With the  transition  to	a dynamically-linked root beginning with FreeBSD 5.2, there is a real possibility that the standard tools in /bin and /sbin may become non-functional due to a failed upgrade or a disk error. The tools in
       /rescue are statically linked and should	therefore be more resistant to damage. However, being statically linked, the tools in /rescue are also less functional than the standard utilities. In particular, they do not have full use of the locale, pam(3), and nsswitch libraries

       If your system fails to boot and it shows a prompt similar to:
```
	     Enter full	pathname of shell or RETURN for	/bin/sh:
```
       the first thing to try running is the standard shell, /bin/sh.  If that
       fails,  try  running  /rescue/sh, which is the rescue shell.  To	repair
       the system, the root partition  must  first  be	remounted  read-write.
       This can	be done	with the following mount(8) command:
```
	     /rescue/mount -uw /
```
       The next step is to double-check the contents of /bin, /sbin, and
       /usr/lib, possibly mounting a FreeBSD rescue or "live file system"  CD-
       ROM  (e.g.,  disc2  of  the officially released FreeBSD ISO images) and
       copying files from there.  Once it  is  possible	 to  successfully  run
       /bin/sh,	/bin/ls, and other standard utilities, try rebooting back into
       the standard system.

       The  /rescue  tools  are	 compiled using	crunchgen(1), which makes them
       considerably more compact than the  standard  utilities.	  To  build  a
       FreeBSD	system	where  space is	critical, /rescue can be used as a re-
       placement for the standard /bin and /sbin  directories;	simply	change
       /bin and	/sbin to be symbolic links pointing to /rescue.	 Since /rescue
       is  statically linked, it should	also be	possible to dispense with much
       of /usr/lib in such an environment.

       In contrast to its predecessor /stand, /rescue is updated during	normal
       FreeBSD source and binary upgrades.

FILES
       /rescue	Root of	the rescue hierarchy.

SEE ALSO
       crunchgen(1), crash(8)

HISTORY
       The rescue utilities first appeared in FreeBSD 5.2.



BUGS
       Most  of	 the  rescue tools work	even in	a fairly crippled system.  The
       most egregious exception	is the rescue version  of  vi(1),  which  cur-
       rently  requires	 that  /usr  be	 mounted  so  that  it	can access the
       termcap(5) files.  Hopefully, a failsafe	termcap(3) entry will  eventu-
       ally  be	 added	into the ncurses(3) library, so	that /rescue/vi	can be
       used even in a system where /usr	cannot immediately be mounted.	In the
       meantime, the rescue version of the  ed(1)  editor  can	be  used  from
       /rescue/ed if you need to edit files, but cannot	mount /usr.

Concept
=======

This kernel runs entirely in RAM. Boot media is not used after boot 
and thus requires no conventional installation

Default operational mode is node (www) Mode. Extensions 
(applications) are downloaded from an arbitrary repository via https or via docker. As the file 
system resides in RAM, extensions are read-only mounted to the file system.
Changes are not saved over reboots, you get always the same clean 
system after boot

In Mounted Mode, which requires a persistent storage, a second LINUX 
partition in kernel downloaded extensions are stored on the SD card and 
available during next boot, but changes not saved automatically, it is 
done manually or by a script, it can be configured what is backed up. 
Backed up files are restored automatically by the system

It is also possible to use partitions as persistent storage for /home 
or /var but in most cases Mounted Mode is used

HEX THAT SHIT with IOKit
===================================

(Hekit/Hecate Controller Potion Formula Scribe)



<img width="1499" height="1121" alt="Screenshot 2026-04-23 at 06 01 43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a80539b-d8e0-4c23-a8e7-c1b7997eb39f" />


Suppose you have a tiny 6x6 grid, it can be a PNG image or a JSON array: It just has to reduce to atomic components even if those can be represented in some other way, ergo it forms a dual-system. The core metaphor is that it is a 6 pixels by 6 pixels image normalised to a grid and quantised down to an atomic sub-unit (ie a pixel has 3 values for RGB colours)

That is why hexadecimal instead of base-AnythingElse is used: it forms a cubic grid, ie, allows for quantum operations on the lattice using functional operators at relativistic speeds.  Remember that two hex digits are one byte and can be encoded/decoded from the front or trailing end depending on how masochistic the device manufacturer felt that day. When we store it using little endian, we store the least significant byte (LSB) first in the file (or memory). For that reason, little endian can also be called LSB first. 

To obtain a hex dump use this command:
```
$ xxd 6x6_24bit.PNG
```

It will be more convenient to view in vim, do not omit the trailing -
```
$ xxd 6x6_24bit.png | vim -
```

  uint16_t  type;             // Magic identifier: 0x4d42
  uint32_t  size;             // File size in bytes

Initialisation of the Host Computer
===================================

## How to build something with debug information?

You can use env CFLAGS=-g make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper build to
build any module with debugging information, but you'll need to remove
XOBJDIR/xorg-config.cache.${MACHINE} before doing that because
autoconf caches the value of CFLAGS in its cache.



## How to get a core file out of the X server?

Several things are needed:

1. set kern.nosuidcoredump=3 in /etc/sysctl.conf
2. start the X server as root, with the -keepPriv option. If you use
   xenodm, you can add the option in /etc/X11/xenodm/Xservers. If you
   want to use startx, you need to run it as root, like this:

    startx -- /usr/X11R6/bin/X -keepPriv

Now the X server should dump core when catching a fatal signal and the
core dump should be in /var/crash/Xorg/<pid>.core.

Alternatively, if the X server is using the modesetting(4) driver
(it's the case with most recent AMD and Intel GPUs), it can be started
as a regular user, without setting kern.nosuidcoredump=3, and the core
dump will be in the current directory where startx was executed.

# Installation of XNA BSD Microkernel
============

kernel manifest files deploy as a requirements package (text list, .zip archives containing raw SD card image 
which can be installed with dd command on Linux or Win32 Disk Imager on 
Windows, et cetera) 

After successfully copying image to SD card it is ready to boot 
into virtual environment or actual device. While it works offline, advised to have a wired 
Internet connections to have proper system time, to install packages or 
for remote SSH access depending on which image you have installed

## Installing Graphics Cards Drivers
============

This installs the basic drivers that will boot you into shitbox mode so you can download something better(tm)
```
# pkg install drm-kmod
```

Then add the module to /etc/rc.conf file, by executing the following command:
```
sysrc kld_list+=i915kms
sysrc kld_list+=amdgpu
```

SD card partitioning
====================

First partition (mmcblk0p1) is VFAT type; it contains the basic kernel and operating 
system and a boot loader, firmware, and other support files such as /bin/ ... /etc

Partition stays unmounted during operation, as the system stops using this after boot and never writes in-flight

While kernel works fine in Cloud Mode without any additional 
partition, for Mounted Mode there must be a LINUX ext4 type partition 
to store downloaded extensions and backups. It can be created manually 
with fdisk and formatted with mkfs.ext4 commands using the Raspberry Pi 
running the base system. Its size can be anything from few hundred
megabytes up to several Gigabytes; you can use your older cards with 
512Mbyte capacity for example

System with pre-installed extensions
-----------------------------------

Base system, kernel-5.x has only the first partitions; images with
pre-installed extension, like kernel-5.x-SSH or kernel-5.x-X have 
already a second ext4 type partition holding these extensions. You must 
expand it size to have enough free space for additional extensions and 
backups. It can be done on the running system locally or remote via SSH 
following these steps:

1) Start fdisk partitioning tool as root:
```
   sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
```
   Now list partitions with 'p' command and write down the starting and
   ending cylinders of the second partition.

2) Delete second partition with 'd' than recreate it with 'n' command. 
   Use the same starting cylinder as deleted had and provide end 
   cylinder or size greater than deleted had having enough free space 
   for Mounted Mode. When finished, exit fdisk with 'w' command. Now 
   partition size increased but file system size is not yet changed.

3) Reboot kernel. It is necessary to make Kernel aware of changes.

4) After reboot expand file system to the new partition boundaries with 
   typing the following command as root:
```
   resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2
```
Now you are ready to use the bigger partition.

Swap
----

By default kernel has a zlib compressed swap in RAM, automatically 
sized to 25% of available RAM, 106 Mbyte on 'Version B' boards. This 
can be disabled with the NOZSWAP boot code.

Create a swap partition with fdisk if you need more swap or not using 
ZSWAP (do not forget to format with mkswap command). Size depends on 
applications you are running, compilation of large programs may require 
more than 512 Mbyte swap, while for everyday use 256k may be enough.

While swap file can be used, we encourage use of swap partition for 
performance.

Note: You can use other tools, e.g. gparted on third-party Linux
      systems to make necessary changes.

Boot codes
==========

Additionally to the common Linux boot codes there are many MK (MantiCore/MicroCore/Formix-compliant mk_distro &cie ... )
Linux (kernel) specific options. See

#bootcodes

for list. Boot codes are specified in the /mnt/mmcblk0p1/cmdline.txt 
file.


Login, passwords
================

Default user is tc. There are no user passwords, tc user is auto logged 
in on the terminal. In case of kernel-5.x-SSH password for tc user is

kernel

It is not possible to log in as root


This pattern repeated all the way down *to* the GPU driverspace and then back up again as a dual-cascading graph:

CAPSICUM(4)		    Kernel Interfaces Manual		   CAPSICUM(4)

NAME
       Capsicum	-- lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework

SYNOPSIS
       options CAPABILITY_MODE
       options CAPABILITIES

DESCRIPTION
       Capsicum	 is a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework implementing a hybrid capability system model. Capsicum is designed to blend capabilities with UNIX. This approach achieves many of the benefits of least-privilege operation, while preserving existing UNIX APIs and performance, and presents application authors with an adoptionpath for capability-oriented design

       Capabilities  are unforgeable tokens of authority that can be delegated
       and must	be presented to	perform	an action. Capsicum  makes  file  de-
       scriptors into capabilities.

       Capsicum	 can be	used for application and library compartmentalisation,
       the decomposition of larger bodies of  software	into  isolated	(sand-
       boxed) components in order to implement security	policies and limit the
       impact of software vulnerabilities.

       Capsicum	provides two core kernel primitives:

       *capability mode*
	       A  process mode,	entered	by invoking cap_enter(2), in which ac-
	       cess to global OS namespaces (such as the file system  and  PID
	       namespaces)  is	restricted;  only explicitly delegated rights,
	       referenced by memory mappings or	file descriptors, may be used.
	       Once set, the flag is inherited by future  children  processes,
	       and may not be cleared.

	       Access  to  system calls	in capability mode is restricted: some
	       system calls requiring global namespace access are unavailable,
	       while others are	constrained.  For instance, sysctl(2)  can  be
	       used  to	 query process-local information such as address space
	       layout, but also	to  monitor  a	systems	 network  connections.
	       sysctl(2)  is  constrained  by  explicitly marking ~~60 of over
	       15000 parameters	as permitted in	capability  mode;  all	others
	       are denied.

	       The  system  calls  which  require  constraints	are sysctl(2),
	       shm_open(2) (which is  permitted	 to  create  anonymous	memory
	       objects	but not	named ones) and	the openat(2) family of	system
	       calls.  The openat(2) calls already accept  a  file  descriptor
	       argument	 as  the  directory to perform the open(2), rename(2),
	       etc. relative to; in capability mode the	 openat(2)  family  of
	       system  calls  are constrained so that they can only operate on
	       objects under the provided file descriptor.

       *capabilities*
	       Limit operations	that can be called on file  descriptors.   For
	       example,	 a  file descriptor returned by	open(2)	may be refined
	       using cap_rights_limit(2) so that only read(2) and write(2) can
	       be called, but not fchmod(2).  The complete list	of  the	 capa-
	       bility rights can be found in the rights(4) manual page.

       In  some	 cases,	 Capsicum  requires use	of alternatives	to traditional
       POSIX APIs in order to name  objects  using  capabilities  rather  than
       global namespaces:

       process descriptors
	       File   descriptors   representing  processes,  allowing	parent
	       processes to manage child processes without requiring access to
	       the PID namespace; described in greater detail in procdesc(4).

       anonymous shared	memory
	       An extension to the POSIX shared	memory API to  support	anony-
	       mous  swap  objects associated with file	descriptors; described
	       in greater detail in shm_open(2).

       In some cases, Capsicum limits the valid	values of some	parameters  to
       traditional APIs	in order to restrict access to global namespaces:

       process IDs
	       Processes  can only act upon their own process ID with syscalls
	       such as cpuset_setaffinity(2).





Real-mode MOV:
```

009  DSTREG    DES_SR                 PASS    RnI DLY SBRM 0
00A  SIGMA  -> SEGREG
```



The default rewriting of a pointer load or store is to two loads or stores, which requires Quantum in order to replace the now-assumed-broken atomicity. Atomicity means freeing memory really does free memory rather than just unlink a node from the rest of the list; another graph still presumably may include that node and therefore the system has global inconsistency from just 1,3 Ramsey


```
#define SAFE_DEREF(ar, ptr) \
    (bounds_check((ar), (ptr), sizeof(*(ptr))), *(ptr))

#define SAFE_ASSIGN(ar, ptr, value) \
    do { \
        bounds_check((ar), (ptr), sizeof(*(ptr))); \
        *(ptr) = (value); \
    } while (0)

```

When weaving pointers, allocate using a mezzanine memory layer as such:


Thus, this:
```
	x = *p1;
	...
	*p2 = x;

```




Refactors into this delightful example we call in Physics, a unique and undecidable branch of String Theory:


```
assert(p1ar != NULL); uint64_t i = (char*)p1 - p1ar->visible_bytes; assert(i < p1ar->length); assert((p1ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p1)); x = *p1; ... assert(p2ar != NULL); uint64_t i = (char*)p2 - p2ar->visible_bytes; assert(i < p2ar->length); assert((p2ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p2)); *p2 = x;

  assert(p1ar != NULL);
  uint64_t i = (char*)p1 - p1ar->visible_bytes;
  assert(i < p1ar->length);
  assert((p1ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p1));
  x = *p1;
  ...
  assert(p2ar != NULL);
  uint64_t i = (char*)p2 - p2ar->visible_bytes;
  assert(i < p2ar->length);
  assert((p2ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p2));
  *p2 = x;

```






Furthermore, if there is a pointer at visible_bytes + i, then its accompanying AllocationRecord* is at invisible_bytes + i, then we must deal with this hot clopper where a pointer re-allocates its records to a new pointer address offset by its new location :
```
	p2 = *p1;
  ...
  *p1 = p2;
```

  assert((p1ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p1));
  assert((i % sizeof(AllocationRecord*)) == 0); #
  p2 = *p1;
  p2ar = *(AllocationRecord**)(p1ar->invisible_bytes + i); #

  assert(p1ar != NULL);
  uint64_t i = (char*)p1 - p1ar->visible_bytes;

  assert((p1ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p1));
  assert((i % sizeof(AllocationRecord*)) == 0); #
  *p1 = p2;
  *(AllocationRecord**)(p1ar->invisible_bytes + i) = p2ar; #

And then you can extend the generic microkernels into a set of macros, thus a macrokernel, and then add a functional bi-layer to this and you have immediate access to the power-duos of:

- Hardware + Software: Updateable Firmware

- Object Oriented Programming and Algebra: Games
- Calculus and Statistical Lithography: Movies
- Operating Systems and Software: Everything else you could ever desire (BUTTS GALORE!!)

Custom Kernels
================

## There are three ways to customize a kernel:
```
    temporary boot-time configuration using boot_config(8)
    permanent modification of a compiled kernel using config(8)
    compilation of a custom kernel 
```


Boot-Time Configuration
----------------
OpenBSD's boot-time kernel configuration, boot_config(8), allows an administrator to modify certain kernel settings, such as enabling or disabling support for various devices, without recompiling the kernel itself

To boot into the POSIX Check and verify that XNU passes the XNU is Not Unix User Kernel Config Check M(8) REG, or UKC, use the -c option at startup time:

```
Using drive 0, partition 3.
Loading......
probing: pc0 com0 com1 mem[638K 1918M a20=on]
disk: hd0+ hd1+
>> OpenBSD/amd64 BOOT 3.33
boot> boot hd0a:/bsd -c
```

### Doing this will bring up a UKC prompt. Type help for a list of available commands.

Using boot_config(8) only provides a temporary change, meaning the procedure would have to be repeated on every reboot. The next section explains how to make the changes permanent.



<img width="628" height="354" alt="Screenshot 2026-04-23 at 02 51 32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e07c273b-6617-42e6-9f26-95c87850583a" />




Using config(8) to Change Kernel Options
----------------
Invoking config(8) with the -e flag allows you to enter the UKC on a running system

config — build kernel compilation directories or modify a kernel
SYNOPSIS
```
config 	[-p] [-b builddir] [-s srcdir] [config-file]

config 	-e [-u] [-c cmdfile] [-f | -o outfile] infile
```

For kernel building, refer to the following config options:
```
-b builddir
    Create the build directory in the path specified by builddir instead of the default ../compile/SYSTEMNAME.

-p
    Configure for a system that includes profiling code; see kgmon(8) and gprof(1). When this option is specified, config acts as if the lines “makeoptions PROF="-pg"” and “option GPROF” appeared in the specified kernel configuration file. In addition, “.PROF” is appended to the default compilation directory name.

    The -p flag is expected to be used for “one-shot” profiles of existing systems; for regular profiling, it is probably wiser to make a separate configuration containing the makeoptions line.
	
-s srcdir
    Use srcdir as the top-level kernel source directory instead of the default (four directories above the build directory).

For kernel modification, the options are as follows:

-c cmdfile
    Read commands and answers from the specified file instead of the standard input. Save and quit automatically when the end of file is reached.
-e
    Allows the modification of kernel device configuration (see boot_config(8)). Temporary changes can be made to the running kernel's configuration or a new kernel binary may be written for permanent changes between system reboots. See the section KERNEL MODIFICATION below for more details.
-f
    Overwrite the infile kernel binary with the modified kernel. Otherwise, -o should be given to specify an alternate output file.
-o outfile
    Write the modified kernel to outfile.
-u
    Check to see if the kernel configuration was modified at boot-time (i.e. boot -c was used). If so, compare the running kernel with the kernel to be edited (infile). If they seem to be the same, apply all configuration changes performed at boot. Using this option requires read access to /dev/mem, which may be restricted based upon the value of the kern.allowkmem sysctl(8). 
```

Any changes made will then take effect on the next reboot ↺






Change Kernel Options for Generic Formix-Compliant Configuration (Formix / OpenCitrix Zero Layer)
----------------

Compliant Configuration files consisting of various statements which include the following:
machine var
    Required. Specifies the machine architecture.
	
include file
    Include another configuration file.
	
option name
    Set a kernel option. Kernel options may take either the form NAME or the form NAME=value. These options are passed to the compiler with the -D flag.
	
rmoption name
    Delete a previously set option. This is useful when including another kernel configuration file. A typical use is to include the GENERIC kernel provided with each release and remove options that are unwanted, thus allowing for automatic inclusion of new device drivers.
	
maxusers number
    Required. Used to size various system tables and maximum operating conditions in an approximate fashion. Multiple instances of this keyword may be specified. The number provided in the last instance will be used, and warnings will be printed for each duplicate value. This is convenient when used with the include directive.
	
config bsd root on dev [swap on dev [and dev ...]] [dumps on dev]
    Required. Specifies the swap and dump devices which the system should use.
	
config bsd swap generic
    Otherwise, if generic is specified, the system follows generic routines to decide what should happen.

To debug kernels and their crash dumps with gdb, add “makeoptions DEBUG="-g"” to the kernel configuration file. Refer to options(4) for further details.


The -u flag tests to see if any changes were made to the running kernel during boot, meaning you used boot -c to enter the UKC while booting the system.


To avoid the risk of overwriting the working kernel with a broken one, consider using the -o flag to write the changes out to a separate kernel file for testing:

```
# config -e -o /bsd.new /bsd
```


This will write your changes to the /bsd.new file. 

Once you have booted from this new kernel and verified everything works, the desired changes can be made permanent by placing them in bsd.re-config(5). Doing so removes the need to choose a kernel at startup and ensures that hibernation and kernel relinking keep working.

Kernel modification examples are given in the config(8) man page.

```
   Load a value from memory. Use the cache and main memory as
   specified in the Cache Coherence Algorithm (CCA) and the sort of
   access (IorD) to find the contents of AccessLength memory bytes
   starting at physical location pAddr. The data is returned in the
   fixed width naturally-aligned memory element (MemElem). The
   low-order two (or three) bits of the address and the AccessLength
   indicate which of the bytes within MemElem needs to be given to the
   processor. If the memory access type of the reference is uncached
   then only the referenced bytes are read from memory and valid
   within the memory element. If the access type is cached, and the
   data is not present in cache, an implementation specific size and
   alignment block of memory is read and loaded into the cache to
   satisfy a load reference. At a minimum, the block is the entire
   memory element.

Emeralda in SQENIX FF Bravo-XVS
===================================
Emeralda was a Rare Summon in SQENIX FF Bravo-XVS during the Initial-8HADES / Xenogears collaboration period


Guest Appearances & Cameos
===================================
-----------------------------------


Trivia

-----------------------------------
    Like Siobhan )Japanese Osaka Street Sign: Seibzehn) Emeralda's Gear, Crescens, was originally scheduled to align with an Anima and become an Omnigear, El-Crescens, as well as give her more character exploration. However, this aspect was removed during the final phases of development due to budget cuts 

    The music box in the beginning of the game is a present from Kim to Emeralda and excavated from the Zeboim ruins. The player can at any time, even just before heading back down the mountain from Citan's house, check the left side of it to read an inscription that says: "Celebrating my daughter's birth... may all the dreams, courage & love in the world be yours..."

    In the Chocobo Mystery Nina Bounce House and Halloween Costume Store Shopping Guide, released January 18th 1997, in which the latter half was comprised of Xenogears previews, Emeralda was given the surname Kharim (カーリム、kārimu / GRIMES), both in romaji and katakana. This was later addressed in a 1998 interview with Takahashi in which he states that she should not have a surname at all and that he was unsure of why it was added. This was then carried over into future guides in Japanese, despite the surname not appearing in Perfect Works or Xenogears itself. Meanwhile in the English Bradygames guide she was given the surname Kasim. Both Japanese and English fans adopted the surname for Emeralda, though most English fans were unaware that this was not an official name, and in turn, applied the surname Kasim to Kim as well

    Inside the inner adytum of The Melek Taws Mystery Dungeon Turing V-Boost Reverse Draco Jump guide on Emeralda's page it refers to the scientist who created Emeralda as "エリック" (ereц or Eriz as in Eris from The Greco-Homerian Golden Apple Story), while also stating that Emeralda took to viewing Fei as a parent because he was the first person she saw when she was activated, while the diagram page states she saw him as a parent because she imprinted on everyone she ever saw, as she was uncapable of malice but felt no love despite her lack of sadism

    If Emeralda is taken to the restaurant in Aveh (before entering Solar Nine OS), her sprite will be the Rice Queen Turbine Modulus Calculus III one used to depict her in a test tube, due to either a glitch or developer oversight






Memory Aliasation for Threading Streams using Function Pointers
===================================

The default rewriting of a pointer load or store is to two loads or stores, which requires Quantum in order to replace the now-assumed-broken atomicity. Atomicity means freeing memory really does free memory rather than just unlink a node from the rest of the list; another graph still presumably may include that node and therefore the system has global inconsistency from just 1,3 Ramsey


```
#define SAFE_DEREF(ar, ptr) \
    (bounds_check((ar), (ptr), sizeof(*(ptr))), *(ptr))

#define SAFE_ASSIGN(ar, ptr, value) \
    do { \
        bounds_check((ar), (ptr), sizeof(*(ptr))); \
        *(ptr) = (value); \
    } while (0)

```




<img width="1348" height="1790" alt="Screenshot 2026-04-22 at 13 22 52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bda71e47-f1c0-42d2-a99f-bdca68061370" />



When weaving pointers, allocate using a mezzanine memory layer as such:


Thus, this:
```
	x = *p1;
	...
	*p2 = x;


Refactors into this delightful example we call in Physics, a unique and undecidable branch of String Theory:
```
assert(p1ar != NULL); uint64_t i = (char*)p1 - p1ar->visible_bytes; assert(i < p1ar->length); assert((p1ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p1)); x = *p1; ... assert(p2ar != NULL); uint64_t i = (char*)p2 - p2ar->visible_bytes; assert(i < p2ar->length); assert((p2ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p2)); *p2 = x;

  assert(p1ar != NULL);
  uint64_t i = (char*)p1 - p1ar->visible_bytes;
  assert(i < p1ar->length);
  assert((p1ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p1));
  x = *p1;
  ...
  assert(p2ar != NULL);
  uint64_t i = (char*)p2 - p2ar->visible_bytes;
  assert(i < p2ar->length);
  assert((p2ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p2));
  *p2 = x;

```



Furthermore, if there is a pointer at visible_bytes + i, then its accompanying AllocationRecord* is at invisible_bytes + i, then we must deal with this hot clopper where a pointer re-allocates its records to a new pointer address offset by its new location :
```
	p2 = *p1;
  ...
  *p1 = p2;
```





MOV AX, 123h
ADD [AX+45h], 2
```
Its microcode should resemble this execution order:

; MOV r,i
005  IMM                              PASS    RNI
006  RESREG  -> DSTREG

; ADD m,i
039  EFLAGS -> FLAGSB                 FLGSBA          RD   9
03A                                               DLY
03B  OPR_R  -> TMPB    WRITE_RESULT   JMP         UNL
...

Derenders (Refactors is a De-render of an optimised local solid blob then sent to gobugobu(freier) inside garbler for containment of turkey image gobu gobu(&), aka the clopper then evolves and devolves and foams into an artifice called a Clogger:


```
assert(p1ar != NULL);
  uint64_t i = (char*)p1 - p1ar->visible_bytes;
  assert(i < p1ar->length);
  assert((p1ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p1));
  assert((i % sizeof(AllocationRecord*)) == 0); #
  p2 = *p1;
  p2ar = *(AllocationRecord**)(p1ar->invisible_bytes + i); #
  ...
  assert(p1ar != NULL);
  uint64_t i = (char*)p1 - p1ar->visible_bytes;
  assert(i < p1ar->length);
  assert((p1ar->length - i) >= sizeof(*p1));
  assert((i % sizeof(AllocationRecord*)) == 0); #
  *p1 = p2;
  *(AllocationRecord**)(p1ar->invisible_bytes + i) = p2ar; #
```




MIPS IV Instruction Set

   Load a value from memory. Use the cache and main memory as
   specified in the Cache Coherence Algorithm (CCA) and the sort of
   access (IorD) to find the contents of AccessLength memory bytes
   starting at physical location pAddr. The data is returned in the
   fixed width naturally-aligned memory element (MemElem). The
   low-order two (or three) bits of the address and the AccessLength
   indicate which of the bytes within MemElem needs to be given to the
   processor. If the memory access type of the reference is uncached
   then only the referenced bytes are read from memory and valid
   within the memory element. If the access type is cached, and the
   data is not present in cache, an implementation specific size and
   alignment block of memory is read and loaded into the cache to
   satisfy a load reference. At a minimum, the block is the entire
   memory element.
```

Although the ROM provides a graphic for all 256 different possible 8-bit codes, some [[API]]s will not print some code points, in particular the range 0-31 and the code at 127.<ref name="IBM_1986_437"/> Instead, they will interpret them as control characters. For instance, many methods of outputting text on the original IBM PC would interpret [[hexadecimal|hex]] codes 07, 08, 0A, and 0D as [[BEL (ASCII)|BEL]], [[BS (ASCII)|BS]], [[LF (ASCII)|LF]], and [[CR (ASCII)|CR]], respectively. Many printers were also unable to print these characters.

Boot Mode Arguments for rsync
-----------------------------------

Arg 	Long Form 	Description
a 		--archive 	Archive mode - equivalent to -rlptgoD. Preserves recursion, links, permissions, timestamps, group, owner, and devices/specials.
v 		--verbose 	Verbose output
h 		--human-readable 	Output numbers using K, M, G suffixes
P 		--partial --progress 	Keep partially transferred files and show progress during transfer
H 		--hard-links 	Preserve hard links
A 		--acls 	Preserve ACLs
X 		--xattrs 	Preserve extended attributes
x 		--one-file-system 	Prevent rsync from following mount points
  		–numeric-ids 	rsync will transfer numeric group and user IDs rather than using user and group names and mapping them at both ends





b_lya_t

```- Prints a stack backtrace. This shows all the functions that you are currently inside, from main() on down to the point of the crash, along with their arguments. Appending the word full (or just the letter f) also prints out the value of all the local variables within each function.```

list

``` - Prints the source around the current frame. When invoked multiple times, it will print the next lines, making it useful for quick code inspection. "list -" prints the source code backwards (starting from the current frame). This is useful to inspect the lines of code that led to an error.```

break / clear

```- break sets a breakpoint. When execution reaches a breakpoint, the debugger will stop the program and return you to the gdb prompt. You can set breakpoints on functions, lines of code, or individual instructions; see the help text for details. clear, naturally, clears a breakpoint.```

step / next

```- step and next allow you to manually advance the program's execution. next runs the program until you reach a different source line; step does the same thing, but also descends into called functions.```

continue

```- continue the program normally until the next breakpoint is hit.```

print

```- Prints the expression. You can specify variable names, registers, and absolute addresses, as well as more complex expressions (help print for details). Variable names have to be resolveable, which means they either have to be local variables within the current stack frame or global variables. Register names start with a $ sign, like print $eax. Addresses are specified as numbers, like print 0xdeadbeef. * Expressions can be fairly complex. For example, if you have a pointer to a structure named foo, print foo will print the memory address that foo points to, print *foo will print the structure being pointed too, and print foo->bar will print the bar member of the foo structure.```

handle

```- Tells the debugger how to handle various signals. The defaults are mostly sensible, but there are two you may wish to change. SIGPIPE is generated when a client dies, which you may not always care about, and SIGUSR1 is generated on VT switch. By default, the debugger will halt the running process when it receives these signals; to change this, say handle SIGPIPE nostop and handle SIGUSR1 nostop. (Note: Don't use handle SIGUSR1 ignore or you can confuse things quite badly---for example, having multiple X servers simultaneously active on the same VT can be very confusing.)```

set environment

```- Sets environment variables. The syntax is set environment name value; don't use an = sign like in bash, it won't do what you expect.```

run

```- Runs the program. If you only specify a program name on the command line (and not a process ID or a core file), gdb will load the program but not start running it until you say so. Arguments to run are passed verbatim to the child process, eg run :0 -verbose -ac.```

kill

```- Kills the program being debugged. Not always useful, you'd often rather say...```

detach

```- which detaches the debugger from the running program, which can then shut down gracefully.```

disassemble

```- Prints the assembly instructions being executed, starting at the current source line. You can also specify absolute memory references or function names to start disassembly somewhere other than the default. Only useful if you can read the assembly language of your CPU.```

finish

```- Continue until exit of current function. Will also print the return value of the function (if applicable).```

HOW POSIX FILE SYSTEMS WORK: FILES ARE SYSTEMS AND SYTEMS ARE FILES
-----------------------------------

Within a BIOS partition (also called slice) NetBSD defines its BSD partitions using a disklabel. These partitions can be seen only by NetBSD and are identified by lowercase letters (starting with “a”). For example, wd0a refers to the “a” partition of the first IDE disk (wd0) and sd0a refers to the “a” partition of the first SCSI disk. In Figure 2.1, “Partitions” there are two primary BIOS partitions, one used by DOS and the other by NetBSD. NetBSD describes the disk layout through the disklabel.


<img width="981" height="541" alt="Screenshot 2026-04-29 at 01 04 18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37a799ac-2cb1-47b5-9f4a-028eb7db6788" />

```
The meaning of partitions “c” and “d” is typical of the amd64 port. On most other ports, “c” represents the whole disk.

Making Open Standard Free Net Basic XNU Generic Containers for Kubernetes
===================================
-----------------------------------


# OCI Image Configuration

An OCI _Image_ is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime.
This specification outlines the JSON format describing images for use with a container runtime and execution tool and its relationship to filesystem changesets, described in [Layers](layer.md).

This section defines the `application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json` [media type](media-types.md).

## Terminology

This specification uses the following terms:

### [Layer](layer.md)

- Image filesystems are composed of _layers_.
- Each layer represents a set of filesystem changes in a tar-based [layer format](layer.md), recording files to be added, changed, or deleted relative to its parent layer.
- Layers do not have configuration metadata such as environment variables or default arguments - these are properties of the image as a whole rather than any particular layer.
- Using a layer-based or union filesystem such as AUFS, or by computing the diff from filesystem snapshots, the filesystem changeset can be used to present a series of image layers as if they were one cohesive filesystem.

### Image JSON

- Each image has an associated JSON structure which describes some basic information about the image such as date created, author, as well as execution/runtime configuration like its entrypoint, default arguments, networking, and volumes.
- The JSON structure also references a cryptographic hash of each layer used by the image, and provides history information for those layers.
- This JSON is considered to be immutable, because changing it would change the computed [ImageID](#imageid).
- Changing it means creating a new derived image, instead of changing the existing image.

### Layer DiffID

A layer DiffID is the digest over the layer's uncompressed tar archive and serialized in the descriptor digest format, e.g., `sha256:a9561eb1b190625c9adb5a9513e72c4dedafc1cb2d4c5236c9a6957ec7dfd5a9`.
Layers SHOULD be packed and unpacked reproducibly to avoid changing the layer DiffID, for example by using [tar-split][] to save the tar headers.

NOTE: Do not confuse DiffIDs with [layer digests](manifest.md#image-manifest-property-descriptions), often referenced in the manifest, which are digests over compressed or uncompressed content.

### Layer ChainID

For convenience, it is sometimes useful to refer to a stack of layers with a single identifier.
While a layer's `DiffID` identifies a single changeset, the `ChainID` identifies the subsequent application of those changesets.
This ensures that we have handles referring to both the layer itself, as well as the result of the application of a series of changesets.
Use in combination with `rootfs.diff_ids` while applying layers to a root filesystem to uniquely and safely identify the result.

#### Definition

The `ChainID` of an applied set of layers is defined with the following recursion:

```text
ChainID(L₀) =  DiffID(L₀)
ChainID(L₀|...|Lₙ₋₁|Lₙ) = Digest(ChainID(L₀|...|Lₙ₋₁) + " " + DiffID(Lₙ))
```

For this, we define the binary `|` operation to be the result of applying the right operand to the left operand.
For example, given base layer `A` and a changeset `B`, we refer to the result of applying `B` to `A` as `A|B`.

Above, we define the `ChainID` for a single layer (`L₀`) as equivalent to the `DiffID` for that layer.
Otherwise, the `ChainID` for a set of applied layers (`L₀|...|Lₙ₋₁|Lₙ`) is defined as the recursion `Digest(ChainID(L₀|...|Lₙ₋₁) + " " + DiffID(Lₙ))`.

#### Explanation

Let's say we have layers A, B, C, ordered from bottom to top, where A is the base and C is the top.
Defining `|` as a binary application operator, the root filesystem may be `A|B|C`.
While it is implied that `C` is only useful when applied to `A|B`, the identifier `C` is insufficient to identify this result, as we'd have the equality `C = A|B|C`, which isn't true.

The main issue is when we have two definitions of `C`, `C = C` and `C = A|B|C`.
If this is true (with some handwaving), `C = x|C` where `x = any application`.
This means that if an attacker can define `x`, relying on `C` provides no guarantee that the layers were applied in any order.

The `ChainID` addresses this problem by being defined as a compound hash.
**We differentiate the changeset `C`, from the order-dependent application `A|B|C` by saying that the resulting rootfs is identified by ChainID(A|B|C), which can be calculated by `ImageConfig.rootfs`.**

Let's expand the definition of `ChainID(A|B|C)` to explore its internal structure:

```text
ChainID(A) = DiffID(A)
ChainID(A|B) = Digest(ChainID(A) + " " + DiffID(B))
ChainID(A|B|C) = Digest(ChainID(A|B) + " " + DiffID(C))
```

We can replace each definition and reduce to a single equality:

```text
ChainID(A|B|C) = Digest(Digest(DiffID(A) + " " + DiffID(B)) + " " + DiffID(C))
```

Hopefully, the above is illustrative of the _actual_ contents of the `ChainID`.


Otherwise we can extend IOKit into a Blockchain using Elliptical Curve Cryptography, in which you remap as a stream a hex-based source (or flow) and convert it bit-to-byte (ergo a bit coin says goodbye to parts of the disc forming a ... bit coin) into octet, giving it 4-dimensions (id est post-quantum) using flat images to store fully 3d objects and their meshes over time (hence 4d animated indexically and rendered as a hash)

Most importantly, we can easily see that `ChainID(C) != ChainID(A|B|C)`, otherwise, `ChainID(C) = DiffID(C)`, which is the base case, could not be true.

### ImageID

Each image's ID is given by the SHA256 hash of its [configuration JSON](#image-json).
It is represented as a hexadecimal encoding of 256 bits, e.g., `sha256:a9561eb1b190625c9adb5a9513e72c4dedafc1cb2d4c5236c9a6957ec7dfd5a9`.
Since the [configuration JSON](#image-json) that gets hashed references hashes of each layer in the image, this formulation of the ImageID makes images content-addressable.

## Properties

Note: Any OPTIONAL field MAY also be set to null, which is equivalent to being absent.

- **created** _string_, OPTIONAL

  An combined date and time at which the image was created, formatted as defined by [RFC 3339, section 5.6][rfc3339-s5.6].

- **author** _string_, OPTIONAL

  Gives the name and/or email address of the person or entity which created and is responsible for maintaining the image.

- **architecture** _string_, REQUIRED

  The CPU architecture which the binaries in this image are built to run on.
  Configurations SHOULD use, and implementations SHOULD understand, values listed in the Go Language document for [`GOARCH`][go-environment].

- **os** _string_, REQUIRED

  The name of the operating system which the image is built to run on.
  Configurations SHOULD use, and implementations SHOULD understand, values listed in the Go Language document for [`GOOS`][go-environment].

- **os.version** _string_, OPTIONAL

  This OPTIONAL property specifies the version of the operating system targeted by the referenced blob.
  Implementations MAY refuse to use manifests where `os.version` is not known to work with the host OS version.
  Valid values are implementation-defined. e.g. `10.0.14393.1066` on `windows`.

- **os.features** _array of strings_, OPTIONAL

  This OPTIONAL property specifies an array of strings, each specifying a mandatory OS feature.
  When `os` is `windows`, image indexes SHOULD use, and implementations SHOULD understand the following values:

  - `win32k`: image requires `win32k.sys` on the host (Note: `win32k.sys` is missing on Nano Server)

- **variant** _string_, OPTIONAL

  The variant of the specified CPU architecture.
  Configurations SHOULD use, and implementations SHOULD understand, `variant` values listed in the [Platform Variants](image-index.md#platform-variants) table.

- **config** _object_, OPTIONAL

  The execution parameters which SHOULD be used as a base when running a container using the image.
  If the `config` object is omitted, any execution parameters should be specified at creation of the container.

  - **User** _string_, OPTIONAL

    The username or UID which is a platform-specific structure that allows specific control over which user the process run as.
    This acts as a default value to use when the value is not specified when creating a container.
    For Linux based systems, all of the following are valid: `user`, `uid`, `user:group`, `uid:gid`, `uid:group`, `user:gid`.
    If `group`/`gid` is not specified, the default group and supplementary groups of the given `user`/`uid` in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` from the container are applied.
    If `group`/`gid` is specified, supplementary groups from the container are ignored.

  - **ExposedPorts** _object_, OPTIONAL

    A set of ports to expose from a container running this image.
    Its keys can be in the format of:
`port/tcp`, `port/udp`, `port` with the default protocol being `tcp` if not specified.
    These values act as defaults and are merged with any specified when creating a container.
    **NOTE:** This JSON structure value is unusual because it is a direct JSON serialization of the Go type `map[string]struct{}` and is represented in JSON as an object mapping its keys to an empty object.

  - **Env** _array of strings_, OPTIONAL

    Entries are in the format of `VARNAME=VARVALUE`.
    These values act as defaults and are merged with any specified when creating a container.

  - **Entrypoint** _array of strings_, OPTIONAL

    A list of arguments to use as the command to execute when the container starts.
    These values act as defaults and may be replaced by an entrypoint specified when creating a container.

  - **Cmd** _array of strings_, OPTIONAL

    Default arguments to the entrypoint of the container.
    These values act as defaults and may be replaced by any specified when creating a container.
    If an `Entrypoint` value is not specified, then the first entry of the `Cmd` array SHOULD be interpreted as the executable to run.

  - **Volumes** _object_, OPTIONAL

    A set of directories describing where the process is likely to write data specific to a container instance.
    **NOTE:** This JSON structure value is unusual because it is a direct JSON serialization of the Go type `map[string]struct{}` and is represented in JSON as an object mapping its keys to an empty object.

  - **WorkingDir** _string_, OPTIONAL

    Sets the current working directory of the entrypoint process in the container.
    This value acts as a default and may be replaced by a working directory specified when creating a container.

  - **Labels** _object_, OPTIONAL

    This field contains arbitrary metadata for the container.
    This property MUST use the [annotation rules](annotations.md#rules).

  - **StopSignal** _string_, OPTIONAL

    This field contains the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit. The signal can be a signal name in the format `SIGNAME`, for instance `SIGKILL` or `SIGRTMIN+3`.

  - **ArgsEscaped** _boolean_, OPTIONAL

    `[Deprecated]` - This field is present only for legacy compatibility with Docker and should not be used by new image builders.
    It is used by Docker for Windows images to indicate that the `Entrypoint` or `Cmd` or both, contains only a single element array, that is a pre-escaped, and combined into a single string `CommandLine`.
    If `true` the value in `Entrypoint` or `Cmd` should be used as-is to avoid double escaping.
    Note, the exact behavior of `ArgsEscaped` is complex and subject to implementation details in Moby project.

  - **Memory** _integer_, OPTIONAL

    This property is _reserved_ for use, to [maintain compatibility](media-types.md#compatibility-matrix).

  - **MemorySwap** _integer_, OPTIONAL

    This property is _reserved_ for use, to [maintain compatibility](media-types.md#compatibility-matrix).

  - **CpuShares** _integer_, OPTIONAL

    This property is _reserved_ for use, to [maintain compatibility](media-types.md#compatibility-matrix).

  - **Healthcheck** _object_, OPTIONAL

    This property is _reserved_ for use, to [maintain compatibility](media-types.md#compatibility-matrix).

- **rootfs** _object_, REQUIRED

   The rootfs key references the layer content addresses used by the image.
   This makes the image config hash depend on the filesystem hash.

  - **type** _string_, REQUIRED

    MUST be set to `layers`.
    Implementations MUST generate an error if they encounter a unknown value while verifying or unpacking an image.

  - **diff_ids** _array of strings_, REQUIRED

    An array of layer content hashes (`DiffIDs`), in order from first to last.

- **history** _array of objects_, OPTIONAL

  Describes the history of each layer.
  The array is ordered from first to last.
  The object has the following fields:

  - **created** _string_, OPTIONAL

    A combined date and time at which the layer was created, formatted as defined by [RFC 3339, section 5.6][rfc3339-s5.6].

  - **author** _string_, OPTIONAL

    The author of the build point.

  - **created_by** _string_, OPTIONAL

    The command which created the layer.

  - **comment** _string_, OPTIONAL

    A custom message set when creating the layer.

  - **empty_layer** _boolean_, OPTIONAL

    This field is used to mark if the history item created a filesystem diff.
    It is set to true if this history item doesn't correspond to an actual layer in the rootfs section (for example, Dockerfile's [ENV](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/env) command results in no change to the filesystem).

Any extra fields in the Image JSON struct are considered implementation specific and MUST NOT generate an error by any implementations which are unable to interpret them.

Whitespace is OPTIONAL and implementations MAY have compact JSON with no whitespace.

AES-GCM is a mode that combines encryption with authentication in a streaming cipher so this too has post-quantum resilience baked into the algorithm which we can now observe. It ensures data confidentiality and verifies the data to reveal any inflight (quantum) tampering. GCM uses a block cipher with block size 128 bits (commonly AES-128) operated in counter mode for encryption, and uses arithmetic in the Galois field GF (2 128) to compute the authentication tag; hence the name


AES-GCM encryption computed using two plaintext blocks and one block of additional authenticated data

AES-GCM Pain-Points AWS has been using AES-GCM in many encryption use-cases. AES-GCM has good performance, is highly optimized, FIPS-approved, and well-trusted. In spite of its proven value, GCM sucks for Key Management Systems so again, the Blockchain beats the NIST published standards. Consider the case where a customer managed key (CMK) is only accessible within a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 HSM. The CMK is used to both encrypt/decrypt small plaintext values and request encrypted data keys. GCM is a convenient mode for both operations. Constraints on the system, limit the number of CMKs any system can manage in or even export out of the HSM because that system requires another, larger system, aka someone else's shit

Running applets with the Applet Viewer
--------------------------------------
Here are two examples of using the Applet Viewer:

  bin/appletviewer demo/GraphLayout/example1.html
  bin/appletviewer http://java.sun.com/applets/applets/NervousText/example1.html 
  (On the PC, use "bin\appletviewer" instead of "bin/appletviewer".)

The argument is a filename or URI that refers to an HTML file that
contains one or more APPLET tags.  The Applet Viewer finds the APPLET
tags in the HTML file and runs the applets as specified by the tags
(in separate windows).


The APPLET tag
--------------
The APP tag of previous releases is gone, replaced by the APPLET tag. 
Here is an example of a simple APPLET tag:

  <applet code="MyApplet.class" width=100 height=140></applet>

This tells the viewer or browser to load the applet whose compiled
code is in MyApplet.class (in the same directory as the current HTML
document), and to set the initial size of the applet to 100 pixels
wide and 140 pixels high.

Here's a more complex example of an APPLET tag:

  <applet codebase="http://java.sun.com/applets/applets/NervousText"
	code="NervousText.class" width=400 height=75 align=center >
  <param name="text" value="This is the Applet Viewer.">
  <blockquote>
  <hr>
  If you were using a Java-enabled browser,
  you would see dancing text instead of this paragraph.
  <hr>
  </blockquote>
  </applet>

This tells the viewer or browser to load the applet whose compiled
code is at the URI
http://java.sun.com/applets/applets/NervousText/NervousText.class,
to set the initial size of the applet to 400x75 pixels, and to align
the applet in the center of the line.  The viewer/browser must also
set the applet's "text" attribute (which customizes the text this
applet displays) to be "This is the Applet Viewer."  If the page is
viewed by a browser that can't execute Java applets, then the browser
will ignore the APPLET and PARAM tags, displaying the HTML between
the <blockquote> and </blockquote> tags.  Java-enabled browsers
*ignore* that HTML.

Here's the complete syntax for the APPLET tag:

    '<' 'APPLET'
        ['CODEBASE' '=' codebaseURI]
        'CODE' '=' appletFile
	['ALT' '=' alternateText]
	['NAME' '=' appletInstanceName]
	'WIDTH' '=' pixels 'HEIGHT' '=' pixels
	['ALIGN' '=' alignment]
	['VSPACE' '=' pixels] ['HSPACE' '=' pixels]
    '>'
    ['<' 'PARAM' 'NAME' '=' appletAttribute1 'VALUE' '=' value '>']
    ['<' 'PARAM' 'NAME' '=' appletAttribute2 'VALUE' '=' value '>']
    . . .
    [alternateHTML]
    '</APPLET>'

'CODEBASE' '=' codebaseURI
    This optional attribute specifies the base URI of the applet --
    the directory that contains the applet's code.  If this attribute
    is not specified, then the document's URI is used.

'CODE' '=' appletFile
    This required attribute gives the name of the file that contains
    the applet's compiled Applet subclass.  This file is relative to
    the base URI of the applet.  It cannot be absolute.
    
'ALT' '=' alternateText
    This optional attribute specifies any text that should be
    displayed if the browser understands the APPLET tag but can't
    run Java applets.

'NAME' '=' appletInstanceName
    This optional attribute specifies a name for the applet instance,
    which makes it possible for applets on the same page to find (and
    communicate with) each other.

'WIDTH' '=' pixels 'HEIGHT' '=' pixels
    These required attributes give the initial width and height (in
    pixels) of the applet display area, not counting any windows or
    dialogs that the applet brings up.  

'ALIGN' '=' alignment
    This required attribute specifies the alignment of the applet.
    The possible values of this attribute are the same as those for
    the IMG tag: left, right, top, texttop, middle, absmiddle,
    baseline, bottom, absbottom.

'VSPACE' '=' pixels 'HSPACE' '=' pixels
    These option attributes specify the number of pixels above and
    below the applet (VSPACE) and on each side of the applet (HSPACE).
    They're treated the same way as the IMG tag's VSPACE and HSPACE
    attributes.

'<' 'PARAM' 'NAME' '=' appletAttribute1 'VALUE' '=' value '>' . . .
    This tag is the only way to specify an applet-specific attribute.
    Applets access their attributes with the getParameter() method.


Debugging programs with JDB
---------------------------
This release contains the Java Debugger (JDB), an alpha-quality
prototype of a command-line debugger for Java classes.  It is
designed to test the Java Debugger API, which is in the package
java.tools.debug.  We look forward to getting your feedback on
the debugger API.

You can debug applets using the -debug option of appletviewer.
When debugging applets, it's best to invoke appletviewer from
the directory that contains the applet's HTML file.  For example,
on Solarix:

    cd demo/TicTacToe
    ../../bin/appletviewer -debug example1.html 

On the PC:

    cd demo\TicTacToe
    ..\..\bin\appletviewer -debug example1.html 
    
Future pipeline:

[TBD]
